- Nicholas was not present, and they confirmed the date for Hannes and Maximilian's presentation on December 13th.
- Maximilian declined to give a colloquium talk due to already having other presentations and wanting to focus on methodological feedback.
- Aaron suggested that Maximilian could present his vision of what he wants to tackle in an extended version of his previous presentation. They will consider Andrea's opinion on the matter.
